		<h1><b>Bug 4779253</b></h1>
		
	<h2><b>Bug Description:</b></h2>
    <p>
	This is a race bug.
    <br>This bug is very hard to reproduce because its buggy interleaving is very difficult to reach. So a short pause is instrumented into the buggy source's byte code to increase the chance to trigger the bug.
<br>
More details about this bug are at
<a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-4779253">JDK-4779253</a> JIRA page.

<h2><b>Interleaving Description:</b></h2>
	<pre>
<b>java.util.logging.Logger</b>

t1  t2  public void log(LogRecord record) {
            if (record.getLevel().intValue() < levelValue || levelValue == offValue) {
                return;
            }
            synchronized (this) {
1,3             if (filter != null && !filter.isLoggable(record)) {
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
            
        public void setFilter(Filter newFilter) throws SecurityException {
            checkAccess();
    2       filter = newFilter;
        }

</pre> 
<p>Precondition:
<br>filter has been initialized to some instance.

<br>a) thread 1 enters synchronized block to check if filter is null at 1. As mentioned in precondition,
   filter is not null,so it continues to check the second condition.
<br>b) just before thread 1 starts to check the second condition, context switched, thread 2 set filter to
   newFilter at 2. Although line 1 is protected by synchronized block, there is no such protection
   at line 2, filter is still free to alter at 2. Here newFilter is null, and filter is set to null.
<br>c) context switched, thread 1 continues to check the second condition after "&&". But now filter is null,
   so a NullpointerException is thrown out.

	<h2>
		<b>How To Reproduce:</b>
	</h2>

	<p>
		This bug is reproduced under JDK 1.6.0 and JDK 1.6.0_33.
        <br>It started at JDK 1.6.0, and has been fixed since JDK 1.7.0.
        <br>Execute the following scripts to run the test to reproduce the bug (assume the location of the jdk6 test project is jdk_test_home).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Linux:</b><br>
		<i>${jdk_test_home}/scripts/4779253.sh  [--javaloc path] [--sleepTime value]</i><br>
		<b>Windows:</b><br>
		<i>%jdk_test_home%\scripts\4779253.bat [--javaloc path] [--sleepTime value]</i><br>
	<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
    <br>
    The default number of sleepTime is 1000 if not specified. For example:
    <br>
       <i>${jdk_test_home}/scripts/4779253.sh</i>
	
	<br>	is the same as:
    <br> <i> ${jdk_test_home}/scripts/4779253.sh --sleepTime 1000</i>
	</p>

			<tr>
				<td>Option</td>
				<td>Function</td>
				<td>Default Value</td>
                <td>Valid Values</td>

			</tr>


			<tr>
				<td>--sleepTime, -st</td>
				<td>milliseconds to sleep between two condition checks where race could happen. Default value is 1000 if
this option is not set explicitly.
				</td>
				<td>1000</td>
                <td>integer</td>


			</tr>

				<td>--javaloc</td>
				<td>The location of JDK that is eligible to reproduce the bug, if your java environment is not eligible.
<br>In this case, it's JDK 1.6.0.
It should be the absolute path to the JDK's java starter and ended with "/".<br>
For example: ~/jdk/home/jdk1.6.0/bin/</td>
