<p>
Precondition: _maxActive=N. N objects have been borrowed from pool with key "A". But no objects are borrowed from pool with key "B". Exhausted action is set to block.
</p>
<p>
    a) thread 1 borrows an object from pool with key "A". Latch A is created at 1 and added to allocation queue at 2. Now _allocationQueue has latch A at the head.
<br>b) thread 1 is blocked at 9 according to the exhausted action.
<br>c) thread 2 borrows an object from pool with key "B". Latch B is created at 10 and added into the rear of allocation queue at 11. Now _allocationQueue has latch A at head and latch B at rear.
<br>d) thread 2 calls allocate at 12 and comes to 14 due to _allocationQueue is not empty. The head of _allocationQueue, which is latch A is fetched at 14.
<br>e) pool with key "A" which is exhausted is fetched at 15. thread 2 is about to borrow object from pool "B", but latch B has no chance to be dealt until latch A is removed from _allocationQueue. So thread 2 is blocked at 19.

	<h2>
		<b>How To Reproduce: </b>
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		This bug is reproduced under pool 1.5 and JDK 1.6.0_33.
        <br>Execute the following scripts to run the test to reproduce the bug (assume the location of the pool test project is pool_test_home).
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>Linux:</b>
	<br>
	<i>${pool_test_home}/scripts/146.sh [--monitoroff]</i>
	<br>
	<b>Windows:</b>
	<br>
	<i>%pool_test_home%\scripts\146.bat [--monitoroff]</i>
    </p>
	<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
	<br>
		Use monitor to report and terminate the program when deadlock happens:
        <br>
        <i>${pool_test_home}/scripts/146.sh</i>
	<br><br>
		Turn off monitor:
        <br> <i> ${pool_test_home}/scripts/146.sh
			--monitoroff</i>
	</p>
	<table border="1">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Option</td>
				<td>Function</td>


			</tr>


			<tr>
				<td>--monitoroff, -mo</td>
				<td>Turn off to stop reporting bug messages and ending program
					when test <br>runs into the expected concurrency bug which is
					a forever waiting.<br> User has to terminate the program
					manually when this option is set.
